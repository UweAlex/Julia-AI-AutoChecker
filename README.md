# Julia-AI-AutoChecker
Julia-AI-AutoChecker is a post-processing linter designed to guarantee executable Julia code from LLMs. It is built in Python because most AI environments can execute Python natively. The tool automatically intercepts and fixes common errors, ensuring the user receives clean, idiomatic, and immediately runnable Julia programs without cleanup.
