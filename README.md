# 🤖 Julia-AI-AutoChecker

**The automatic, invisible correction loop for AI-generated Julia code.**

The Julia-AI-AutoChecker is a Python-based **post-processing tool** designed to guarantee the code quality of Julia programs generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Gemini, GPT-4o, and Grok.

Our core goal is to **completely unburden the end-user** from dealing with typical AI-induced errors. Instead of presenting flawed code, this tool **automatically corrects** Pythonisms, syntax mistakes, and style deviations *before* the code reaches the user.

## ⚠️ Note on AI Code Execution

It is essential to understand that many advanced LLMs (via tools like Code Interpreter or Code Execution) can **natively execute Python code** within their sandbox environment. This capability is crucial for data analysis and debugging their own Python outputs.

However, this fact **does not eliminate the problem** of linguistic interference. The **Julia-AI-AutoChecker** is necessary because:
1. When asked for Julia code, the AI is constrained by the target language but still relies on its vast Python training data, leading to **non-idiomatic syntax** (e.g., `and` instead of `&&`).
2. Your checker specifically validates the code for **Julia conventions**, not just Python functionality, ensuring the code is idiomatic and maintainable.

## 🎯 Why `AutoChecker`? (The Self-Correction Loop)

The AutoChecker acts as a **critical external tool** in the LLM's **Agentic Coding** workflow. The AI generates code, runs it through this tool, receives clear, rule-based feedback (e.g., "replace `and` with `&&`"), and self-corrects until the output is clean.

| Error Type | Example of the AI Error | Correction by `AutoChecker` |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logical Operator** | `if x > 0 and y < 10` | `if x > 0 && y < 10` |
| **Boolean Literal** | `status = True` | `status = true` |
| **Syntax Pattern** | `item not in list` | `!(item in list)` |
| **Redundant Type Check**| `value = T(0.5) * 10` | `value = 0.5 * 10` |

## 🔑 Key Features

* **Fully Automated Correction:** Fixes common Pythonisms (`and`, `or`, `True`, `False`, `not in`) directly in the code, providing the clean output (`fixed_code`).
* **Zero-Friction User Experience:** The end-user receives only the **clean, executable** code.
* **Precision Error Reporting:** Delivers a clear log for non-fixable issues (e.g., block imbalance) for complex self-correction loops.
* **Enforces Julia Idioms:** Ensures the generated code adheres to Julia style guides, improving long-term maintainability.

## 🚀 Integration and Usage

The `Julia-AI-AutoChecker` is designed to be integrated **transparently** into any code generation pipeline—either as an intermediate step in an agent's workflow or as a final post-processing filter.

The tool requires Python 3.x and uses only standard libraries (`re`, `collections`).

    # 1. Clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Julia-AI-AutoChecker.git
    cd Julia-AI-AutoChecker

    # 2. Process code via standard input (Ideal for piping the raw AI output)
    # Example: Your script generates raw Julia code and pipes it to the Checker
    ./ai_script_generate_julia.sh | python lint_julia_v6.py -

### Example Output (Automatic Correction)

When errors are found and corrected, the tool returns the cleaned code:

    ❌ Fixes (2):
    - Python operators: 'and' (use '&&')...
    - Auto-fixed 'not in' to '!(... in ...)' – see fixed_code below

    Fixed code:
    function clean_data(input)
        if !(input in [1, 2]) && input > 0
            return true
        end
    end

### Example AI Dialogue Workflow

This is how an AI agent uses the linter to ensure code quality before delivering the final answer:

| Role | Dialogue | Action in AI Sandbox |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User** | "I have uploaded **`lint_julia.py`**. Use it to validate and correct all Julia code before presenting it." | Sets the **self-correction rule** for the agent. |
| **User** | "Write a Julia function `check_values(x, y)` that returns true if x is positive **AND** y is even." | **KI generates code:** `if x > 0 and iseven(y) return true end` |
| **AI (Internal Step)** | *Runs the generated code through `lint_julia.py`.* | **Linter returns:** `❌ Python operators: 'and' (use '&&')...` |
| **AI (Self-Correction)** | *The AI automatically revises its code to replace `and` with `&&`.* | **Final code:** `if x > 0 && iseven(y) return true end` |
| **AI Output to User** | "The function has been generated and validated with the linter. It is Julia-compliant:"     ```julia     function check_values(x, y)         if x > 0 && iseven(y)             return true         end     end     ``` | **Result:** User receives correct code without seeing the initial error. |
